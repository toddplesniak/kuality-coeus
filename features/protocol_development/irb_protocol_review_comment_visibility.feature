Feature: IRB Protocol Review Comment Visibility

  As an IRB Admin, I want to ensure Protocol review comments
  are visible, or not, to the appropriate personnel, because TBD...

  Background:
   # * Users exist with the following roles: IRB Administrator, Protocol Creator
   # * the IRB Admin submits a Committee with at least one event and four or more paid, voting members
   # * the Protocol Creator creates an IRB Protocol in the Committee's home unit
   # * assigns a committee member the the Protocol's personnel
   # * submits the Protocol to the Committee for review
   # * the IRB Administrator assigns reviewers to the Protocol
   # * the IRB Administrator edits the meeting details to make it available to reviewers
   # * the primary reviewer submits review comments

  Scenario: Approved Primary Reviewer Comments are Private and Final
    * Users exist with the following roles: IRB Administrator, Protocol Creator
    * the IRB Admin submits a Committee with at least one event and four or more paid, voting members
    * the Protocol Creator creates an IRB Protocol in the Committee's home unit
    * assigns a committee member the the Protocol's personnel
    * submits the Protocol to the Committee for review
    * the IRB Administrator assigns reviewers to the Protocol
    * the IRB Administrator edits the meeting details to make it available to reviewers
    * the primary reviewer submits review comments
    Given the IRB Admin sets the flags of the primary reviewers comments to Private and Final
    And   the IRB Admin approves the primary reviewers review(s)
    When  the IRB Admin approves the primary reviewers comment(s)
    Then  the secondary reviewer can see the primary reviewer's comment in Submission Details
    And   the principal investigator can't see the primary reviewer's comment in Submission Details
    And   the non-reviewing committee member can't see the primary reviewer's comment in Submission Details
    And   the uninvolved committee member can see the primary reviewer's comment in Submission Details
    And   the secondary reviewer can see the primary reviewer's comment in the meeting minutes
