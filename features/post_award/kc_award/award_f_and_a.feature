Feature: Award F&A Rates

  As an Award Modifier, I want the system to help
  ensure that I don't make mistakes when entering
  F&A Rate information

  Background:
    * a User exists with the role: 'Award Modifier'
    * the Award Modifier creates an Award

  Scenario: Missing F&A Rate fields
    When  the Award Modifier adds an F&A rate to the Award but misses a required field
    Then  an error should appear saying the field is required

  Scenario: Invalid Fiscal Year
    When the Award Modifier adds an F&A rate with an invalid fiscal year
    Then an error should appear that says the fiscal year is not valid

  Scenario: Default dates based on entered fiscal year
    When the Award Modifier adds an F&A rate to the Award
    Then the default start and end dates are based on the F&A rate's fiscal year
