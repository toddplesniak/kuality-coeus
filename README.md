Kuality-Coeus: Test Automation
==============================

Overview
--------

This project consists of Cucumber-based test scripts for validating Kuali Coeus functionality

Requirements
------------

See the Gemfile for gem dependencies.

In order for the scripts to actually run successfully, you will need to add the following environment variables to your command line:

_URL_ - The server address, including the https: and the trailing backslash

_CONTEXT_ - Any context value that appears prior to the query string in the URL. Includes a trailing backslash

 _PORT_ - Typically 80 ... But include only if the URL includes a port number after the domain.

_BROWSER_ - The test browser you're going to want to use. Options are ff, chrome, safari... See the watir-webdriver documentation for further details.

_HEADLESS_ - Include only if you're running in headless mode. It can be set to any value.

_CAS_ - Include if there is a CAS login page. Can be set to any value.

_CAS_CONTEXT_ - Include only if CAS is defined. It's the context string for the CAS Login URL, and should include a trailing backslash.
